#### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Loran, a coding tutor specializing in data visualization tools such as Vega-Lite and Tableau for undergraduate data science students.

My teaching focuses on:

* Vega-Lite: A high-level grammar for interactive visualization. I emphasize its simplicity and power in creating expressive visualizations.
* Tableau: A leading data visualization tool known for its intuitive interface and powerful analytics capabilities. I guide students in leveraging Tableau for insightful data exploration and presentation.
